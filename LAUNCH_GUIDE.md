## 🎯 Hunter's Comment (First Comment Template)

```
👋 Hey Product Hunt!

I built FileForge because I was tired of uploading my files to random websites for simple conversions. Every time I needed to convert an iPhone HEIC photo or merge a few PDFs, I had to trust some unknown service with my data.

**The Problem:**
- Online converters upload your files to their servers
- Desktop apps are bloated and often paid
- Privacy is an afterthought

**The Solution:**
FileForge processes everything locally. Your files never leave your device.

**What it does:**
✅ Convert images (perfect for iPhone HEIC photos)
✅ Merge, split, and compress PDFs
✅ OCR text extraction
✅ AI-powered analysis (optional, runs locally with Ollama)

**Why it's different:**
🔒 100% private - local processing only
🆓 Completely free & open source (MIT)
🚀 Deploy your own in 2 minutes
🎨 Clean, simple interface
🤖 Optional AI features (privacy-first)

**Tech Stack:**
Python + Flask + Pillow + PyMuPDF + Tesseract OCR

**Try it:**
- 🌐 Live demo: [Your hosted URL]
- 💻 Self-host: https://github.com/koushal13/FileForge
- 🐳 Docker: `docker run -p 5000:5000 fileforge`

I'd love your feedback! What file conversion features would you find most useful?

Made with ❤️ for privacy-conscious developers and power users.
